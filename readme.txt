Having just finished, I'd firstly like to say that this project was a lot of fun and I learned a ton doing it.


NGC 7296-
	The CMD for this cluster is incredibly noisy as we were unable to remove stars that are not part of the cluster from the foreground/background. The stars are very well aligned (2041/2070 are within 1.0 arcsec of their positions from each band). Giving overall results that are good. 

King 20-
	My CMD for this cluster looks great! It is a little bit 'noisier' than the one found on webda but there is still a clear main sequence, and the similarities are clear. I bet that if we changed the scale on the axis to match that of webda it would look even more similar. All but one of the 719 stars are within 1.0 arcsec of their positions in each band giving an awesome result at the end.
